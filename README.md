# NOTICE

### Guayadeque development is back

The announcement by @anonbeat that Guayadeque project has reached the end of its development and
was no longer actively maintained let us very sad because you know, we Guayadeque users love it so much!

That said, I want to say I am following @anonbeat track and continuing the Guayadeque development.
The main focus right now is keeping it running in the most recent Linux releases and fixing issues.

**We want to thank @anonbeat** for his amazing work to bring us the incredible music player that Guayadeque is and

contributions to Guayadeque development.
