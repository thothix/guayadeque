### Optional dependencies

#### Extra audio playback support

- `gstreamer1.0-libav`: Provides support for a wide range of audio and video codecs, enabling Guayadeque to play more media formats (like `DSD/DSF`).
- `gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad`: Includes additional GStreamer plugins for enhanced functionality, but may have stability or licensing issues.
- `gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly`: Offers support for certain audio and video formats that may have distribution or patent issues in some countries.

#### Other

- `libgpod-dev`: Offers comprehensive support for managing and interacting with iPod devices.
- `gvfs`: Allows Guayadeque to access and manage files through GVFS (GNOME Virtual File System), which is useful for handling remote or virtual file systems.

##### Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian 12

```bash
sudo apt install libgpod-dev gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly
```

##### Arch Linux
